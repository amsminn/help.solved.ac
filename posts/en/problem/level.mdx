**Problem levels** are the difficulties assigned to problems on Baekjoon Online Judge by solved.ac contributors.

Since the problem levels are determined by contributors, they may change over time except for some problems with fixed levels.

## Tiers

The general problem levels are divided into 30 tiers. From the bottom to the top of the table, and the lower the number, the higher the tier.

Each problem has a **level value** from 1 to 30. <Tier t={1} /> is given 1 point, <Tier t={2} /> is given 2 points, and so on, up to <Tier t={30} />. The top 100 problems with the highest level values are used for calculating the AC rating.

| Tier | Icon | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <Ruby>Ruby</Ruby> V &ndash; I | {new Array(5).fill(0).map((_, i) => <Tier key={i} t={i + 26}/>)} | Few or no teams solves the problem in international championships |
| <Diamond>Diamond</Diamond> V &ndash; I | {new Array(5).fill(0).map((_, i) => <Tier key={i} t={i + 21}/>)} | Hard problems for programming contests |
| <Platinum>Platinum</Platinum> V &ndash; I | {new Array(5).fill(0).map((_, i) => <Tier key={i} t={i + 16}/>)} | Typical to hard problems for programming contests |
| <Gold>Gold</Gold> V &ndash; I | {new Array(5).fill(0).map((_, i) => <Tier key={i} t={i + 11}/>)} | Hard problems for coding interviews |
| <Silver>Silver</Silver> V &ndash; I | {new Array(5).fill(0).map((_, i) => <Tier key={i} t={i + 6}/>)} | Typical problems for coding interviews |
| <Bronze>Bronze</Bronze> V &ndash; I | {new Array(5).fill(0).map((_, i) => <Tier key={i} t={i + 1}/>)} | For beginners in algorithm problem-solving |

### Sprout Problems

<ExternalLink href="https://solved.ac/problems/sprout">Sprout Problems List</ExternalLink>

Some easy problems recommended by solved.ac for beginners are classified as <Tier sprout t={1} /> <Sprout>Sprout</Sprout> level and are marked with a light green icon.

Sprout level problems have the same level as <Bronze>Bronze</Bronze> level problems with the same number. Similarly, the level values of Sprout problems are <Tier t={1} sprout /> 1 point, <Tier t={2} sprout /> 2 points, and so on, up to <Tier t={5} sprout /> 5 points.

| Tier | Icon | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <Sprout>Sprout</Sprout> V &ndash; I<sup>+</sup> | {new Array(6).fill(0).map((_, i) => <Tier key={i} t={i + 1} sprout />)} | Easy problems recommended for beginners |

### Special Cases

There are some problems that do not fall into the above categories due to various reasons such as lack of contributions. The level values of the following problems are 0.

- <Tier t={0} /> <b><Unrated>Unrated</Unrated></b>: Problems with no contributions yet
- <Tier t={0} locked /> <b><Unrated>Not ratable</Unrated></b>: Problems that cannot be rated
- <WarningIcon /> <b>Problem-solving Warning</b>: Problems with a rated level of 0 due to reasons such as duplicate problems and problem errors

For more information on these levels, please refer to the guide [**Special Cases of Problem Levels**](/en/problem/level-unusual).
