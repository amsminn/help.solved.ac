Hello! This is **solved.ac**, the community powered guide for programming challenges.

On June 5, 2025, it has been five years since BOJ and solved.ac were integrated. solved.ac introduces new features and changes through season updates on an approximately yearly basis. To celebrate the 5th anniversary, we are launching the **Season 5 Update**.

## 'OVER RATING' Added (Scheduled for July)

A new rating that reflects only the 1,000 most difficult problems you have solved will be updated. This rating will be called **OVER RATING** and will be displayed separately from the existing AC rating.

## Partial Change to AC Rating Calculation Formula

The bonus based on the number of problems solved in the AC rating calculation formula will be changed as follows.

- Previous: $\left\lfloor 175\times \left(1-0.995^{\left(\text{Number of problems solved}\right)}\right) \right\rceil$
- Changed: $\left\lfloor 200\times \left(1-0.997^{\left(\text{Number of problems solved}\right)}\right) \right\rceil$
