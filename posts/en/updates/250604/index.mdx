title: If Your Streak Didn't Continue Even After Solving a Problem

Hello, I am Suhyeon Park (shiftpsh), the executive director of solved.ac.

With the advent of the AI era, not only have bots crawling solved.ac increased significantly compared to last year, but they have also become much more aggressive.
As a result, there have been occasional server downtimes, and consequently, issues such as streaks not being updated or streak freezes not being applied have frequently occurred.
Regardless of the reason, it is my fault for not designing a sufficiently stable system, and I apologize for causing you concern.

I am planning to take measures such as setting up separate web and calculation servers as soon as possible to reduce server errors, but for the time being, if your streak is broken or similar issues occur even after you have solved a problem,
please feel free to leave a recovery request in the '스트릭 문제 복구 스레드'(Streak Issue Recovery Thread) on the solved.ac Discord ([link](https://solved.ac/community)).
Alternatively, you can send a recovery request email to shift (at) solved (dot) com with your BOJ ID and the date that needs to be recovered, and I will process it within a week.
