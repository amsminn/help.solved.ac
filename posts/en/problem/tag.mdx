<ExternalLink href="https://solved.ac/problems/tags">Problems by Tag</ExternalLink>

**Tags** are classifications of tools and methods used to solve problems, based on the opinions submitted by solved.ac contributors.

Some types of tags include:

- **Algorithms**: Greedy algorithms, brute force algorithms, sorting, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Stacks, queues, trees, etc.
- **Famous Problem Types**: Traveling salesman problem, etc.
- **Topics**: Mathematics, geometry, ad hoc, etc.
- **Input/Output Formats**: UTF-8 input processing, etc.

Like problem levels, tags are determined by contributors, so they may change over time except for some problems with fixed tags.

Some tags are inclusive. For example, the "number theory" tag is included in the "mathematics" tag, so all problems with the "number theory" tag also have the "mathematics" tag.

## Names

![Tag Names](/tag/tag-names.png)

The bold text in tags represents the tag's name. Tag names indicate the main tools or methods used to solve problems and are used to summarize the characteristics of problems.

Tag names can be set separately from the site language. You can change the [Tag display language] setting in the [Problem List] tab of the [solved.ac settings](https://solved.ac/settings/problem_list).

## IDs and Tag-Based Problem Search

The small text in tags represents the tag's ID. Tag IDs can be used as filters in solved.ac advanced search. Here are some examples:

- `#dp`: Problems with the dynamic programming tag
- `#math`: Problems with the mathematics tag

## Tag Ratings

In addition to the AC rating, tag ratings are calculated for tags with more than 500 problems registered on solved.ac. The formula for calculating tag ratings differs slightly from the formula for calculating AC ratings. For more information, please refer to the guide below.
